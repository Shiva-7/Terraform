This is Day-3 of terraform learning 
In this we are going to explore a modular approach 
we create files for each and every section of code such as for(main,outputs,variables)
we created the terraform.tfvars as this is were we initiated our default values for our terraform script 

lets make sure we are using the below commands in running this script 

terraform init - initializes our terraform env
terraform plan - gives us a blue print of our scritps terraform env
terraform apply - aplies the changes and runs the code 
terraform destroy - used to delete the resources craeted using terraform
